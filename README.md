# SeniorProj2
A basic demo for my high school senior year research project. Enables two android phones to automatically connect and transmit an image from one phone to another over bluetooth, if the other phone does not already posses said image. Needs some serious work.

The objective of the project was to enable easy peer-to-peer sharing of images in authoritarian regimes where internet access is limited.
